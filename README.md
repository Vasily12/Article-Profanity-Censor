# Article Profanity Censor

This project was developed as part of the final year Computer Science dissertation. The project itself aimed to develop a web application to combat online article profanity. More specifically, by replacing observed profane words within the article text with non-profane words that suit the context of the sentence.

## Implementation

During the development of this project, I used ***Spring Boot*** and ***Flask*** as the back-end, ***React*** as the front-end and ***MySQL*** as the database. The *Spring Boot* framework enabled me to arrange the software functionality as a collection of loosely coupled services, thus achieving a service-oriented architecture that is much more maintainable, scalable and secure than a monolithic architecture.

Furthermore, to implement the aim of replacing profane words with non-profane words based on the context of the sentence, I incorporated a *transformer-based* machine learning technique called ***BERT***. I also used the *Hugging Face* library to develop a masked language model that I trained on the BERT database.

# Results

Results from this project indicated that the model's accuracy was relatively low, which I plan to work on and improve as I learn more about machine learning techniques and their impacts on prediction accuracy.
